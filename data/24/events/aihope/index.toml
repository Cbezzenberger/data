AI x Hope: Towards Futures of Human-AI Interdependence

We stand at a crucial point in shaping how Human-AI cooperation will evolve and are witnessing the birth of a new internet. We aim to approach this flippening with [Existential Hope](https://www.existentialhope.com/), and foster futures where humans and machines coexist to flourish ✨. 

​Our belief is that a healthy and harmonious development of decentralized artificial general intelligence (AGI) can arise from an enlightened vantage point. Specifically, we hope to empower builders, researchers, creators and investors exploring positive futures and protocols at the intersection of AI, crypto and creativity, with AI x Hope as an enabler for coordination in sharing technical, research-based and values-aligned perspectives.

We will converge through panel discussions, keynotes and workshops and think far and wide on the ways to align the nascent AI x crypto space for this new paradigm, where our collective synergy—in data, values and protocols—is all we need. 

Curated by [Seed Club Ventures](https://seedclub.ventures/) and [Foresight Institute](https://foresight.org/).
