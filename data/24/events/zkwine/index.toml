​​Come join us for some wine and zero knowledge discussions at a low-key venue.

There will be a variety of friends: zk cryptographers, defi builders, L1/2/3/4 maxis and more. But what we all have in common: a love for zero knowledge (and wine).

​​Remember, you need to download the Payy app to get in. Get it ahead of time at [https://payy.link/download](https://payy.link/download%EF%BF%BC%EF%BF%BCIf)
