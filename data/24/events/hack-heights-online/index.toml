The Hack'N Heights Online Hackathon is dedicated to showcasing how decentralized data can redefine our digital interactions. Our mission is to foster an environment where our bounty sponsors' combined technologies and frameworks—Chainlink, The Graph Protocol, Plurality Network, soonami.io and Pinax—illustrate the compelling advantages of web3 approaches.

We anticipate developers will create exciting applications and explore blockchain technology's next wave of billion-dollar data-related use cases. Chainlink provides decentralized oracles, seamlessly integrating off-chain data into the blockchain world. Similarly, The Graph Protocol efficiently indexes and queries blockchain data, making it accessible for dApps and the broader off-chain landscape. Additionally, Plurality Network offers an onboarding solution, aggregating variable user data from social platforms that can be leveraged for both on-chain and off-chain use cases. We believe developers can craft amazing applications at this intersection of data and blockchain, eagerly look forward to the innovations to come!

This event seeks to illuminate the cohesive power of these technologies, demonstrating their compatibility and strength in solving complex data problems.

What to Expect:

Global Participation: Engage from any location worldwide, facilitated by our seamless collaboration with Foundance.org, known for its robust digital hackathon platform.
