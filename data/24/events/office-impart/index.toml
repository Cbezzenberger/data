description = "As a part of OFFICE IMPARTs current exhibition 'Accepting the Job' artist Constant Dullaart will do a Live-performance on Thursday, May 23rd. A close reading with an oracle, speaking in machine learned tongues, with a voice derived from sci-fi related voice-over intonations, accompanied by overtly humanized MIDI rhythms. Performed in collaboration with Chris Wratt. Sign up to attend."
