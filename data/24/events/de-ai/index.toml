**Building the New Internet**
​DeAI comes to Berlin. Join the New Internet builders network for DeAI Society, a series of curated talks, working groups, dinners and events, where you will be featured in our documentary about the builders of the New Internet! 🎥
​
​Present your project and meet with founders, builders and investors to define the future of composable decentralized AI and the New Internet stack for a DeAI Society.

​​~ 🌐
The smartest builders in the world are currently running in those two opposite directions: one working towards the exponential increase in machine intelligence and utility (AGI), the other is running towards more trusted global information systems (web3).

​The New Internet is the synthesis of two seemingly incompatible emerging computing paradigms combining the best elements of both paradigms to achieve a decentralized AGI that is natively aligned with the best interest, values, preferences and intelligence of humanity.

​The New Internet stack: Agent Centricity, Proto-Apps, AI Protocol, Verifiable Data, API Composability, Distributed Modularity, Agentic Workflows, Verifiable Computing, Consumer GPU Acceleration, Abstract Computing Markets, Mechanism Design, Creative Networks.

~💡 📸 🎬
The documentary will be produced by [Newforum](https://twitter.com/newforum_nco?lang=en), the research network for deAI and web3 founders, investors, researchers and creators launched by [Newfoundation](https://new.foundation/).

Filming and art direction of the documentary by [Antonio Pedro ](https://antoniopedro.co/)and [Hugo Hoppmann](https://www.hugohoppmann.com/) from the Newfoundation team. Presenters will receive a recording guide and dress code 📸 🤳🏽🧢
