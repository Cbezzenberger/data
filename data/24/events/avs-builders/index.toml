description = """
​If you are building, or want to build an AVS on top of EigenLayer (or any other rapidly growing restaking ecosystems), this meetup is for you. 

​1. How to design Dual Token Staking  - add your own token to provide economic security to your protocol, too!

​2. Comparison of Native Dual Staking, Modular Dual Staking, and Veto Dual Staking

​3. How to design a good slashing mechanism?

​4. How to design your AVS for rapid bootstrapping of economic security behind it, and minimize the risk of AVS failure? 

​Developers behind AVS-es will meet, share challenges and  design patterns, and learn from each other to build more resilient and economically secure decentralized systems.
