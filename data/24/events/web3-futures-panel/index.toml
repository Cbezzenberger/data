For our second Web3 Futures event, we are collaborating with WebZero to tackle the question:

Fueling Emerging Technologies: What role do institutions play in building digital futures?

Innovation doesn't just happen. It takes an institutional mindset that facilitates new business creation, IP ownership, and talent acquisition. Berlin, with its thriving blockchain ecosystem, is doing something right. The question is: what can we teach teach the rest of the world? In this panel, we bring three of Berlin's biggest institutions (IHK, Berlin Senate, and Berlin Partner) together to discuss what role institutions play in building the future of the decentralized web - a mission that is famously anti-institution?

Our Panelists:
- Anna Borodenko, IHK Coordinator for Digitalization, IT Security and AI
- Isabella Hermann, Stiftung Zukunft Berlin
- Norbert Herrmann, Senate Department for Economic Affairs, Energy and Public Enterprises, Head of Startup Affairs

Promoted by Jakob Zwiers, Berlin Partner, Project Manager Innovation | Information and Communication Technology | Blockchain & IT-Security
